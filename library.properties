sentence=The better LedControl library for the MAX7219 and the MAX7221 Led display drivers.
paragraph="It can do everything LedControl can (it is mostly compatible), works with more boards (like esp32) and makes working with LedMatricies easier. You can more your displayed data around, set whole segments and have way more symbols for 7-segment displays. If you still miss a feature just create a pull request and I will do my best to add it ASAP. !!There have been a few major changees in Version 1.7 and you might have to refactor parts of your code to get your code working with the current version if it was built for an older Version of the LedController!!"
