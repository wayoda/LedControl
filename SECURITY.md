# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The versions below will get security fixes if they are reported.
There will be a seperate branch for the continued version (eg. a branch 1.5.x).
All fixes will also be applied to the master branch if applicable, so the latest version should have all the features and fixes.

Because of several problems in versions older than 1.5, I will not provide fixes for them.
Please consider updating, 1.5 is backwards compatible with older version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.7.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.6.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.5.x   | :white_check_mark  |
| < 1.5.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabliliy as soon as you find it.
Simply create a security advisory and I will try to fix is as soon as possible.
If you have fixed a bug or vulnerability yourself you can simply create a pull request with the fix.
