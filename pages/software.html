<h1>The Arduino library code</h1>
<p>The LedControl library was initially written for Arduino boards based on 8-bit
AVR processors.  But since the code does not use any sophisticated internal
functions of the processor it is highly portable und should run on any
Arduino(-like) board that supports the <code>pinMode()</code> and <code>digitalWrite()</code>
functions.</p>
<p>A single MAX72XX Led driver is able to control 64 Leds. The library supports up
to 8 daisy chained MAX72XX drivers. Controlling 512 Leds should be more than
enough for most purposes. </p>
<p>The library code comes with three <a href="https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl/tree/master/examples">demo
sketches</a>. Your
probably want to have a look at this code while reading this section. The demo
code is well documented and provides some insight how all the different parts of
the library work together.</p>
<h2><a id="Init"></a>Library initialization</h2>
<p>To include the library into your Arduino code you have to write a few lines of
initialization code. </p>
<h3>Add the library to your sketch</h3>
<p>This works like with any other Arduino libray, you can either use the 
<code>Include Library</code> menu function from IDE, or you simply add an </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>#include "LedControl.h"</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>statement to the top of your sketch.</p>
<h3>Create a LedControl variable</h3>
<p>All library API-functions are called through a variable of type
<code>LedControl</code> which should be defined right at the top
of your sketch to make it acessible to the rest of the projects code.</p>
<p>The typical code for library initialization looks like this :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* Include the LedControl library */</span> 
<span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>

<span class="cm">/* Create a new LedControl variable.</span>
<span class="cm"> * We use pins 12,11 and 10 on the Arduino for the SPI interface</span>
<span class="cm"> * Pin 12 is connected to the DATA IN-pin of the first MAX7221</span>
<span class="cm"> * Pin 11 is connected to the CLK-pin of the first MAX7221</span>
<span class="cm"> * Pin 10 is connected to the LOAD(/CS)-pin of the first MAX7221</span>
<span class="cm"> * There will only be a single MAX7221 attached to the arduino </span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>  
<span class="n">LedControl</span> <span class="n">lc1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">LedControl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span> 
</pre></div>


<p>The initialization code for the variable through which we <em>talk</em> to the MAX72XX
devices takes 4 arguments. The first 3 arguments are the pin-numbers on the
Arduino that are connected to the MAX72XX. These can be any of the digital
IO-pins on an arduino.  In the example pins <code>12</code>,<code>11</code> and <code>10</code> where choosen
arbitrarily. The library code does no sanity checks on the pin-numbers to be
<em>valid</em> in any way.  Passing in something stupid (pin <code>123</code> ??), or simply the
<em>wrong</em> pin-number will break the code without notice or error messages.  You
don't have to initialize the IO-pins as outputs or set them to a certain state,
the library will do that for you.</p>
<p>The fourth argument to <code>LedControl(dataPin,clockPin,csPin,numDevices)</code> is the
number of cascaded MAX72XX devices you're using with this <code>LedControl</code>. The
library can address up to 8 devices from a single <code>LedControl</code>-variable. There
is a little performance penalty implied with each device you add to the chain,
but the amount of memory used by the library-code will stay the same, no matter
how many devices you set. Since one <code>LedControl</code> cannot address more than 8
devices, only values between 1..8 are allowed here.</p>
<p>If you sketch needs to control more than 8 MAX72XX, another
<code>LedControl</code>-variable needs to be created that uses 3 different pins on your
arduino-board. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>
<span class="c1">// Create a LedControl for the first 8 devices...  </span>
<span class="n">LedControl</span> <span class="n">lc1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">LedControl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// ... and another one for the next 8 devices.   </span>
<span class="n">LedControl</span> <span class="n">lc2</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">LedControl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">);</span> 
</pre></div>


<h3>Get the number of attached devices</h3>
<p>There is no way to read the IO-pin numbers from the code, but there is a
function that gets the maximum number of devices attached to an <code>LedControl</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">/* Gets the maximum number of devices attached to this LedControl.</span>
<span class="c"> * Returns :</span>
<span class="c"> *   int the number of devices attached to this LedControl */</span> 
<span class="nt">int</span> <span class="nt">LedControl</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nd">:getDeviceCount</span><span class="o">();</span> 
</pre></div>


<p>The function is used to loop over the full list of attached MAX72XX devices.
Here is a piece of code that switches all of the MAX72XX-devices from
power saving mode into normal operation.  The idea behind this code 
should be clear even though the <a href="#ShutdownMode"><code>shutdown(addr)</code></a> function is 
introduced later on.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>

<span class="n">lc1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">LedControl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setup</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
    <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">lc1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getDeviceCount</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">lc1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">shutdown</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">);</span> 
    <span class="p">}</span> 
<span class="p">}</span> 
</pre></div>


<p>We iterate over the list of devices by an index that runs from 0 to
<code>getDeviceCount()-1</code>. The index is the <em>address</em> of each device. 
This <em>address</em> is the first argument of <strong>every</strong> function that sets 
a feature or a (Led-)value on a device. 
Note that <code>getDeviceCount()</code> returns the number of devices attached, but the
<em>address</em> of an device starts at 0 for the first one, 1 for the second one,..
<code>getDeviceCount()-1</code> for the last one. </p>
<h3><a id="ShutdownMode"></a>Power saving mode</h3>
<p>Leds consume quite a lot of energy when they are lit. Battery operated devices
need a way save power by switching the whole display off, when the user doesn't
need it. The MAX72XX supports a power shutdown mode.</p>
<p>In shutdown mode the device switches off all the Led's on the display, but the
data is retained. When the device comes out of shutdown mode the same Leds will
be lit as before it went to sleep. It is even possible to send new data during
shutdown mode.  When the device is reactivated, the new data will appear the
display. Here is an example for an <em>invisible</em> countdown on a 7-segment display:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>void countDown() { 
    int i=9; 
    lc.setDigit(0,(byte)i,false); 
    //The digit &#39;9&#39; appears on the display 
    delay(1000); 
    //Go into shutdown mode 
    lc.shutdown(0,true); 
    //and count down silently 
    while(i&gt;1) { 
        //data is updated, but not shown
        lc.setDigit(0,(byte)i,false); 
        i--; 
        delay(1000); 
    } 
    //Coming out of shutdown mode we have already reached &#39;1&#39; 
    lc.shutdown(0,false);
    lc.setDigit(0,(byte)i,false); 
} 
</pre></div>


<p>Here is the prototype for method <code>LedControl.shutdown(addr,status)</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* </span>
<span class="cm"> * Set the shutdown (power saving) mode for the device</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params :</span>
<span class="cm"> *   addr   The address of the display to control</span>
<span class="cm"> *   status If true the device goes into power-down mode. Set to false</span>
<span class="cm"> *          for normal operation.</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w"> </span>void<span class="w"> </span>shutdown<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>bool<span class="w"> </span>status<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Note</strong> : The <code>MAX72XX</code> is <em>always</em> in shutdown mode when the Arduino is powered up.</p>
<h3><a id="SetupScanLimit"></a>Limiting the number of digits (ScanLimit)</h3>
<p><em>This is a kind of experts feature not really needed by most users of the
library. Since the library initializes the</em> <code>MAX72XX</code> <em>to safe default values,
you don't have to read this section just to make your hardware work</em></p>
<p>When a new LedControl is created it will activate all 8 digits on all devices.
Each <em>lit</em> digit will be switched on for 1/8 of a second by the multiplexer
circuit that drives the digits. If you have any reason to limit the number of
scanned digits the Led's get switched on more frequently, and therefore will be
on for longer periods of time. </p>
<p>The effect of setting the scan limit to 4 is that a lit Led is now switched on
for 1/4 of a second instead of the standard 1/8 of a second. The <code>MAX72XX</code> has
to provide the current on the segment-driver for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>You should read the relevant section of the <code>MAX72XX</code> datasheet carefully! Its
actually possible to <strong>destroy</strong> a <code>MAX72XX</code> by choosing a bad combination of
resistor <code>RSet</code> that limits the current going through the Led's and the number
of digits scanned by the device. The only reason to tweak the scanlimit at all,
is that the display looks too dark. But this is most likely due to the fact that
the <a href="#SetupBrightness">intensity</a> on was not raised on startup.  Here's the
prototype of <code>setScanLimit()</code> for those who need it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* Set the number of digits (or rows) to be displayed.</span>
<span class="cm"> * See datasheet for side effects of the scanlimit on the brightness</span>
<span class="cm"> * of the display.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params :</span>
<span class="cm"> *   addr     The address of the display to control</span>
<span class="cm"> *   limit    The number of digits to be displayed</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"> </span>
void<span class="w"> </span>setScanLimit<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>limit<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"> </span>
</pre></div>


<h3><a id="SetupBrightness"></a>Setting display brightness</h3>
<p>There are three factors that determine the brightness of a display.</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of resistor <a href="hardware#SelectRSet"><code>Rset</code></a> which
    limits the maximum current going through the Led's.</li>
<li>the <a href="#SetupScanLimit">scan limit</a> of the display. <em>(If you read the
    section, you already know that I'd recommend to leave this option its safe
    default.)</em></li>
<li>and a comand that allows the brightness of the Leds to be controlled from
    software.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the <code>setIntensity(int addr, int intensity)</code> method the brightness of the
Leds can be set in 16 discrete steps(<code>0..15</code>). Higher values make the display
brighter.  Values greater than 15 will be discarded without changing the
brightness.  Even the lowest value <code>0</code> will not switch the display off
completely off. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* Set the brightness of the display.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> *   addr the address of the display to control</span>
<span class="cm"> *   intensity the brightness of the display.</span>
<span class="cm">void setIntensity(int addr, int intensity); </span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Device initialization</h3>
<p>When a new <code>LedControl</code> is created the library will initialize the hardware with</p>
<ul>
<li>the display cleared </li>
<li>the intensity set to the minimum</li>
<li>the device in power saving mode</li>
<li>the maximum number of digits on the device activated</li>
</ul>
<p>A blanked display is probably what everybody wants on startup. But with the
intensity at a minimum and the device in shutdown-mode no Leds will light up in
the startup configuration. Most users will do their own initialization inside
the <code>setup()</code>-function. Here is a piece of code that can be used as a template
for creating an <code>LedControl</code> that is ready to light up Leds at a medium
brightness as soon as display data arrives.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>

<span class="n">LedControl</span> <span class="n">lc</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">LedControl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="p">}</span> 
</pre></div>


<h2><a id="Matrix"></a>Led-Matrix</h2>
<p>With all the initialization code in place its now time to control some Leds.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/ArduinoOnMatrix.jpg" /> </p>
<h3>Clearing the display</h3>
<p>The name of the function <code>LedControl.clearDisplay(addr)</code> already suggests what
it does.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* Switch all Leds on the display off.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> *   addr The address of the display to control </span>
<span class="cm">*/</span><span class="w"> </span>
void<span class="w"> </span>clearDisplay<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span>addr<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"> </span>
</pre></div>


<p>All Leds on the selected device are switched off. Its important to understand
that this is different from <a href="#ShutdownMode">shutdown mode</a>, where the data is
retained. </p>
<h3>Control a single Led</h3>
<p>This is the prototype of the function that switches a single Led on or off.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* Set the status of a single Led.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params :</span>
<span class="cm"> *   addr  address of the display</span>
<span class="cm"> *   row   the row of the Led (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> *   col   the column of the Led (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> *   state If true the led is switched on, if false it is switched off </span>
<span class="cm">*/</span><span class="w"> </span>
void<span class="w"> </span>setLed<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>row<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>col<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>boolean<span class="w"> </span>state<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"> </span>
</pre></div>


<p>The idea behind the <code>addr</code> and <code>state</code> arguments should be clear, but what do
the <code>row</code> and <code>column</code> arguments refer to? This depends on the wiring between
the <code>MAX72XX</code> and your matrix. The <code>LedControl</code>-library assumes the setup used
in this schematic:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/LedMatrix.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are 8 rows (indexed from 0..7) and 8 columns (also indexed from 0..7) in
the matrix. If the Led located at the very right of the 3'rd row from the top is
to be lit, the index of the Led <code>2.7</code> must used as the row and column arguments.</p>
<p>This code excerpt shows how few Leds on the first MAX72XX device are set</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>//switch on the led in the 3&#39;rd row 8&#39;th column of the device at addr=0 
lc.setLed(0,2,7,true); 
//now the Led at row 0, second from the left side
lc.setLed(0,0,1,true); 
delay(500); 
//switch the first Led off (second one stays on) 
lc.setLed(0,2,7,false); 
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>setLed()</code> function is fine for lighting up a few Leds, but if more Leds
need to be updated, this would require many lines of code. So there are two more
functions in the library, that control a complete row and column with a single
command.</p>
<h3>Control the row of a matrix</h3>
<p>The <code>setRow(addr,row,value)</code>-function takes 3 arguments. The first one is the
already familiar address of the device. The second one is the row that needs to
be updated and the third one the value to be set for this row.</p>
<p>The <code>value</code> argument takes an 8-bit wide byte where each bit set to <code>1</code>
represents a lit led and a bit set to <code>0</code> a Led that is to be switched off. </p>
<p>For an example, the Leds marked in red are to be switched on, all others
switched off.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/LedMatrixSetRow.jpg" /></p>
<p>The index for the row to be updated is <code>2</code> (counted from the top).  The <code>value</code>
argument has to be set to the byte-value for the Leds to be lit.  The easiest
approach is to include the standard header-file <code>&lt;binary.h&gt;</code> into to your
sketch. The value is written in binary encoding is an exact mapping between bits
set to <code>1</code> and the Leds to be switched on. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>//include this file at the top of your Sketch
&lt;binary.h&gt;

// ...Initialization code omitted ...

//Setting the leds from the third row (index=2) of the first device 
lc.setRow(0,2,B10110000); 
</pre></div>


<p>When specifying the value in binary encoding is not possible, a simple table
that maps the decimal values of each bit to the Led it affects can help. The two
rows at the bottom show the decimal value for the example is to be calculated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>value=176 (128+32+16)</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statement <code>lc.setRow(0,2,176)</code> updates the third row on the
first <code>MAX72XX</code> attached to the Arduino. </p>
<p>The <code>setRow()</code>-call is obviuosly much faster than calling <code>setLed()</code> 
eight times for all the Leds in a row. The Hardware of a <code>MAX72XX</code> 
causes the <code>setRow()</code> function also to be 8 times faster than the 
<code>setColumn()</code> function introduced in the next section. 
If performance of the sketch code is important factor use the <code>setRow()</code> 
function whereever possible.</p>

<h3>Control the column of a matrix</h3>
<p>The <code>setColumn()</code>-function works just like the <code>setRow()</code>command

<h2><a id="7Seg"></a>Control 7-Segment displays</h2>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/ArduinoOn7Segment.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Print numbers on a 7-Segment display</h3>
<p>The most common use of 7-segment displays is to print numbers. The LedControl library 
has a function that simply takes an argument of type byte and prints the corresponding 
digit on the specified column. Valid values for the digit are from <code>0</code> to <code>15</code> to allow 
displaying hex values . Values greater than 15 (or negative values) are silently discarded. 
The function also provides an argumment to switch decimal point on the column on or off.</p>
<p>Here is a code excerpt that prints an int value (-999..999) on a display with 4 digits.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>void printNumber(int v) {  
    int ones;  
    int tens;  
    int hundreds; 
    boolean negative;

    if(v &lt; -999 || v &gt; 999)  
        return;  
    if(v&lt;0) {  
        negative=true; 
        v=v*-1;  
    }
    ones=v%10;  
    v=v/10;  
    tens=v%10;  
    v=v/10; hundreds=v;  
    if(negative) {  
        //print character &#39;-&#39; in the leftmost column  
        lc.setChar(0,3,&#39;-&#39;,false);  } 
    else {
        //print a blank in the sign column  
        lc.setChar(0,3,&#39; &#39;,false);  
    }  
    //Now print the number digit by digit 
    lc.setDigit(0,2,(byte)hundreds,false);
    lc.setDigit(0,1,(byte)tens,false); 
    lc.setDigit(0,0,(byte)ones,false); 
}

<p>The <code>digit</code>-argument must be in the range 0..7 because the MAX72XX can control
up to eight digits on a 7-segment display. </p>
<h3>Print characters on a 7-Segment display</h3>
<p>There is a limited set of characters that make (visual) sense on a 7-segment
display. A common use would be the <code>-</code> character to prepend negative values and the 6
characters from 'A'..'F' for integer hex-values.</p>
<p>The <code>setChar(addr,digit,value,dp)</code>-function accepts a value of type char for the
in the range of a 7-bit ASCII encoding. Since the recognizable patterns are
limited, most of the defined characters will print the <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>-char. But there
are quite a few characters that make sense on a 7-segment display.</p>
<p>Here is the set of printable characters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code> </li>
<li><code>A a</code> (prints upper case) </li>
<li><code>B b</code> (prints lower case) </li>
<li><code>C c</code> (prints lower case) </li>
<li><code>D d</code> (prints lower case) </li>
<li><code>E e</code> (prints upper case) </li>
<li><code>F f</code> (prints upper case) </li>
<li><code>H h</code> (prints upper case) </li>
<li><code>L l</code> (prints upper case) </li>
<li><code>P p</code> (prints upper case) </li>
<li><code>-</code> (the minus sign) </li>
<li><code>. ,</code> (lights up the decimal-point) </li>
<li><code>_</code> (the underscore) </li>
<li><code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code> (the blank or space char)</li>
</ul>
<p>The hexadecimal characters (<code>0..F</code>) have been redefined at the
character values 0x00...0x0F. This makes it possible to mix digits 
and characters values. The byte value for the <code>setDigit()</code>-function 
can be used with the <code>setChar()</code> and will print the hexadecimal 
representation of the value.</p>
<p>The prototype of the function looks very similar to the one for displaying
digits.</p>

<h2><a id="Demos"></a>Library Demos</h2>
<p>The library comes with three well documented 
<a href="https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl/tree/master/examples">demo sketches</a>. 
Basic methods to control a Led-Matrix, a 7-Segment display 
and access to daisy-chained MAX72XX devices are shown. The demos might be a good start
for writing your own sketches.</p>
